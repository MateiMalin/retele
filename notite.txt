Rezumat pentru proiect:
Client :
telemetry -> udpate the speed and the location for the car
connect -> connect the car to the server
subscribe -> subscribe to the whole package, or mayber separately
report accident -> report the accident on a street name

Server:
daily -> send the information for subscription
reduce_speed -> the name says it
anounce accident -> the name says it, again

Graphial interface -> i dont know yet, maybe put all the coordinates on a blank area
and have cars on different points (lat, long) with street name, would look kinda plain, tho

Ideas:
- have a struct for each car
- have a struct for each street 

Today : make the skeleton, the structs , without functions working for both the server and the client

ar trebui sa primesc instant mesaj cand ma conectez cu un client la server despre locatie si limita de viteza

pentru informatii: nu cred ca ar trebui sa modific ceva, sincer

ce functii concurente cunosti
daca clientul are port
diferente intre tcp si udp
diferente iso/oxi - tcp/ip
nr de nivele
