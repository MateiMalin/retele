Rezumat pentru proiect:
Client :
telemetry -> udpate the speed and the location for the car
connect -> connect the car to the server
subscribe -> subscribe to the whole package, or mayber separately
report accident -> report the accident on a street name

Server:
daily -> send the information for subscription
reduce_speed -> the name says it
anounce accident -> the name says it, again

Graphial interface -> i dont know yet, maybe put all the coordinates on a blank area
and have cars on different points (lat, long) with street name, would look kinda plain, tho

Ideas:
- have a struct for each car
- have a struct for each street 

Today : make the skeleton, the structs , without functions working for both the server and the client
